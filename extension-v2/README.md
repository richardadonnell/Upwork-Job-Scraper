Upwork Job Scraper v2

This is a minimal starter for a Chrome extension rewritten in TypeScript, React, Tailwind, ShadCN, Sentry and Cheerio.

Quick start

1. From the `extension-v2` folder install deps:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Dev UI (Vite):

```powershell
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production:

```powershell
npm run build
```

Load `extension-v2/public/manifest.json` as the manifest when loading unpacked extension in Chrome (after building the UI assets into `dist`).
