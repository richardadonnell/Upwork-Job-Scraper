** Think carefully, step by step. **
** IMPORTANT: CODE LOCATION RESTRICTIONS BELOW**

- All code changes must be made ONLY within the ./upwork-job-scraper sub-directory
- DO NOT modify any files outside of ./upwork-job-scraper
- DO NOT modify the "sentry.js" file (as previously noted)

---

1. Code Style & Structure:

- Use camelCase for variable and function names
- Use PascalCase for class names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Add error handling with try/catch blocks
- Include detailed console logging for debugging
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations

2. Chrome Extension Guidelines:

- Follow Chrome Extension Manifest V3 requirements
- Handle background script lifecycle properly
- Use chrome.storage.sync for settings
- Use chrome.storage.local for job data
- Implement proper cleanup in event listeners
- Handle extension context invalidation

3. Error Handling:

- Wrap background operations in try/catch
- Log errors to console and activity log
- Use Sentry for error reporting
- Include contextual information in error messages
- Handle network failures gracefully
- Implement fallback behaviors

4. Job Scraping Rules:

- Respect Upwork's rate limits
- Handle logged-out scenarios
- Validate scraped data structure
- Implement retry logic for failed scrapes
- Store only essential job data
- Limit stored jobs to prevent memory issues

5. Webhook Integration:

- Validate webhook URLs
- Handle webhook failures gracefully
- Implement retry logic for failed webhooks
- Include relevant job data in payload
- Add timeout for webhook requests
- Log webhook success/failure

6. UI/UX Guidelines:

- Implement responsive design patterns
- Show loading states during operations
- Provide clear feedback for user actions
- Keep interface clean and minimal

7. Performance:

- Minimize DOM operations
- Use efficient selectors
- Implement proper cleanup
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use debounce for frequent operations
- Clear unused data periodically

8. Security:

- Sanitize user inputs
- Validate webhook URLs
- Handle sensitive data carefully
- Use secure communication
- Implement proper CORS handling
- Follow content security policies

9. Testing:

- Test login detection logic
- Verify webhook functionality
- Test job scraping accuracy
- Validate storage operations
- Check notification system
- Test error handling paths

10. Documentation:

- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Document complex logic
- Include usage examples
- Maintain README updates
- Document configuration options
- Add inline comments for clarity
